# Boss-Machine

This project is an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today’s most accomplished entrepreneurs. The idea is to create routes to manage your ‘minions’, your brilliant ‘million dollar ideas’, and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule. This video is a demonstration of how the app works: https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/programs/build-apis/solution-videos/BossMachine480.mov This project was made with Javascript and uses Express.js, webpack, cors, body-parser, faker.
